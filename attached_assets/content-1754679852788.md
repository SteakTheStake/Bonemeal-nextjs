# Resource Packs

Note that thanks to the [converter](https://github.com/flodri/RGBA-Formats-Converter/releases/tag/0.4) **any resource packs with PBR materials** can support this format with some clicks and almost no work. This list only contains resource packs specifically created/modified with LabPBR in mind.
